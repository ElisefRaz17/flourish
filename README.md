# WElCOME TO FLOURISH 🌸

## Send a compliment a day to boost the encouragement another person's way ❤️

### This is the starting repository for Flourish's web application, feel free to read more down below


## Our mission

###### The world is better when we uplift each other and at Flourish we believe that providing this chat application can do that. When you log into our page we
###### direct you to a support page that gives you a few channels to choose from like shown below.

###### Once you have chosen a channel you can get help, guidance, advice or even make someone's day through the designated chat. For example, our User Rebecca may want 
###### to talk about something Personal, she would click on the Personal option and that will take her to the Personal channel and as you can see below she can spark
###### a conversation anonymously with another user. How cool is that?? 😃 And we can assume Rebbeca is having a silly chat with the user in this dialogue we see here 😂
