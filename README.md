## Our mission

###### The world is better when we uplift each other and at Flourish we believe that providing this chat application can do that. When you log into our page we
###### direct you to a support page that gives you a few channels to choose from like shown below.

###### Once you have chosen a channel you can get help, guidance, advice or even make someone's day through the designated chat. For example, our User Rebecca may want 
###### to talk about something Personal, she would click on the Personal option and that will take her to the Personal channel and as you can see below she can spark
###### a conversation anonymously with another user. How cool is that?? üòÉ
